Neural Network for Scent Pairing Prediction
This project involves a neural network designed to predict whether two scents taste good together. By analyzing various scent attributes and training on a dataset of scent pairings, the neural network can make recommendations for compatible scent combinations, providing valuable insights for perfume creation, food pairings, or other scent-based applications.

Features
Scent Pairing Prediction: The model predicts whether two scents combine well together based on their individual attributes.
Neural Network Model: Built using TensorFlow, PyTorch for training and prediction.
Data-driven Approach: Trained on a dataset of scent pairings with various attributes 

Interactive Interface: Allows users to input two scent names and receive a prediction on whether they taste good together.
